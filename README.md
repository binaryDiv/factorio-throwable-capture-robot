# Factorio Mod: Throwable Capture Bot

Factorio mod that replaces the capture bot rocket with a throwable capture bot capsule, making the rocket launcher obsolete in a pacifist run.

You can install the mod using the in-game mod manager, or by downloading it from the mod portal page linked above to your game's `mods` directory.


## Mod description

This mod adds a throwable **Capture bot capsule**, which works in the same way as the **Capture bot rocket**, except that you throw them like grenades instead of firing them from a rocket launcher.

This is especially useful when you play without enemies, because you don't need to craft a rocket launcher just for the purpose of capture bots.

By default, the capture bot capsule will **replace** the capture bot rocket, meaning that the rocket will be completely removed. Recipes like the biolab that require a capture bot rocket are adjusted to use the capsule instead. However, there is a mod setting to disable the replacement of the rocket, in which case the mod only adds the capsule as an alternative to the rocket, but leaves the rocket and recipes intact.

The recipe for the capture bot capsule is the same as for the capture bot rocket.

## Mod compatibility

The mod has full compatibility with [Pacifist](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Pacifist). If you choose to replace the capture bot rocket with the capsule (which is the default), Pacifist will remove the rocket launcher, since it doesn't serve a purpose anymore.

If you encounter any mod incompatibilities, please leave a comment (see below).
