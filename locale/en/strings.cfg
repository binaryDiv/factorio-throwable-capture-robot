[mod-name]
throwable-capture-robot=Throwable Capture Bot

[mod-description]
throwable-capture-robot=Replaces the capture bot rocket with a throwable capture bot capsule, making the rocket launcher obsolete in a pacifist run.

[mod-setting-name]
throwable-capture-robot-replace-rocket=Replace capture bot rocket with capsule

[mod-setting-description]
throwable-capture-robot-replace-rocket=By default, the capture bot rocket is fully replaced by the capture bot capsule, which means the rocket is removed from the game. Recipes that have the rocket as an ingredient (e.g. the Biolab) are adjusted to use the capsule instead.\n\nDisable this setting if you want to keep the capture bot rocket, only adding the capsule as an alternative to the rocket.
